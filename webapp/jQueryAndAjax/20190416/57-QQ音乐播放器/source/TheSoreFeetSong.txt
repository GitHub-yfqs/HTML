I walked ten thousand miles, ten thousands miles to see you
我步行千万里路，千万里路，只为见你
And ever gasp to breath, I grabbed it just to find you
每次捕捉呼吸，为寻觅你
I climbed up every hill to get to you
我每越过一座山，更靠近你
I wandered ancient lands to hold just you
我漫游古老国度，紧握住你
And every single step of the way, I paid
这一路，我踏过的每个单独足迹
Every single night and day I searched for you
每一个找寻你的孤寂昼夜
Through sand storms and hazy dawns I reached for you
消解风沙和薄雾的清晨，我终于到达你
